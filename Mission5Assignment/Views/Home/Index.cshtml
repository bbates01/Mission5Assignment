                    <p class="lead text-dark">Cars have been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember; there's something intoxicating about the way they combine engineering, design, and emotion into a single machine. I especially love the sound of an engine revving — that visceral growl and the rhythm of shifts are thrilling and remind me of raw performance. I also love the way cars look: the proportions, curves, and purposeful details make each model feel like a rolling piece of art. Two of my favorites on this page are the classic Ford GT40 for its legendary racing pedigree and aggressive stance, and the 2025 Lotus Emira for its modern lines and lightweight engineering.</p>
